## Hi, I'm [Olu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olu-a)👋

I’m a Cloud Engineer focused on building secure, scalable infrastructure on AWS and Azure using Infrastructure as Code.

My projects demonstrate how I design cloud environments using Terraform, apply security best practices, and automate controls to improve reliability, visibility, and governance.

### Featured Projects
- **AWS Account Governance** – Multi-account AWS governance implementation using Organizations, Identity Center, centralized logging, Config rules, Security Hub, and cost controls.
- **Automated S3 Remediation** – Detection and automated remediation of publicly accessible S3 buckets using AWS Config and Systems Manager.
- **Terraform AWS Web Architecture** – End-to-end Terraform project deploying a secure, scalable web application infrastructure on AWS.

## I’m Currently Learning
- **Terraform for scalable IaC** (modules, workspaces, testing).   
- **DevSecOps practices**, integrating security scans into CI/CD pipelines.

### 🧰 Technologies I Work With

- **Cloud Platforms:** AWS, Azure  
- **Automation:** Terraform, Python, Bash  

### Security & Governance (Supporting Focus)
- Security-aware cloud design
- Risk-informed control implementation
- Familiarity with ISO 27001, NIST CSF, GDPR, HIPAA
